# üìÑ‚úè Diamond Price Prediction Model using Python-Flasküíé
<br>
The aim of this project is to predict the price of a diamond provided it's certain features such as :<br> 
carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, x, y, z and price.<br>
The goal is to accurately predict the price of diamonds to be able to help diamond manufacturers, wholesalers, 
and retailers use price prediction models to estimate the market value of diamonds. <br>
Assist investors in evaluating the potential return on investment (ROI) when considering diamond-related investments.<br>
Market analysis and research.
